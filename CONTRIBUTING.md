## Contributing

To contribute, follow these steps: 
1. Fork the repository
2. Fill out [the config file](https://github.com/Aetheryx/remindme/blob/master/src/config-example.json) and rename it to `config.json`
3. Test to see if it works
4. Run `npm test` and make sure there are no linting errors
5. Submit your PR and sit tight

Code-wise, keep things simple. I don't mind hacky code as long as it's somewhat understandable and performant, and I can't think of a better solution myself.

In your PR, describe:
* what you did
* why you did it
* how you did it
